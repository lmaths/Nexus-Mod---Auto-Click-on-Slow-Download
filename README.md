# Nexus Mod - Auto Click on Slow Download  

Automate the download process on Nexus Mod! 🎮  

## 📌 About the Project  

If you're using [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) with the free version of Nexus Mod, you know how tedious it is to manually click the **"Slow Download"** button every time a mod downloads.  

This script solves that problem by automatically clicking the button when needed. Now, you can leave your downloads running while you do other things—or even sleep! 😴💤
